# Ingredients:

2 tablespoons oil, divided
1 lb (500g) boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch | 2cm pieces
1/2 teaspoon salt, to taste
1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon each garlic powder and onion powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
8 oz (250g) sliced brown mushrooms
3 tablespoons (2 oz | 60g) butter
1 brown shallot, chopped
1 green bell pepper (capsicum), seeded and chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced / 2 teaspoons
2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley

# Instructions:

In a mixing bowl, combine 1 lb (500g) of boneless chicken thighs cut into 1-inch pieces with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper, 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, and 1/2 teaspoon paprika. Mix well to ensure the chicken is evenly coated with the seasonings.

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the seasoned chicken pieces. Sear the chicken all over until browned and cooked through, about 5-6 minutes. Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate; set aside and keep warm.

Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in the same skillet with 1 tablespoon of the 3 tablespoons butter. Add 8 oz (250g) of sliced brown mushrooms and cook, while stirring, until just beginning to brown and soften, about 3-4 minutes.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the skillet. Let it melt and sauté 1 chopped brown shallot and 1 seeded and chopped green bell pepper (capsicum) until just soft and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add 4 cloves of minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Add the cooked chicken back into the skillet along with any juices released while resting. Mix through all of the ingredients to evenly coat in the pan juices. Continue cooking until all vegetables are soft and the chicken is cooked through, about 1-2 more minutes.

Taste test and season with salt and pepper, if desired. Garnish with 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped parsley and serve warm.
