- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped

### Liquids

## Instructions

1. **Heat the wok**: Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a wok and heat over medium heat.
2. **Sear the shrimp**: Add the shrimp, season with salt and pepper, and sear for 2 minutes per side until they just start to turn pink.
3. **Deglaze the pan**: Pour in 2 tablespoons of white wine (or broth) and scrape up any browned bits from the pan.
4. **Add flavorings**: Stir in 4 tablespoons of butter, 1 1/2 tablespoons of minced garlic, 1 finely chopped red bell pepper, and 1/4 cup of chopped parsley.
