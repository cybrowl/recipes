# Chinese Lemon Chicken

A tangy, keto-friendly dish with crispy chicken coated in a zesty lemon sauce, perfect for a low-carb dinner.

## Ingredients

### Chicken
- 10.5 oz (300 g) chicken tenderloins, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 medium egg
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce (or tamari for gluten-free)
- 1 tablespoon Chinese Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry, optional for strict keto)
- 4 tablespoons avocado oil (or coconut oil, for frying)

### Lemon Sauce
- 1/2 tablespoon avocado oil
- 1.5 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1/4 cup chicken broth (check for no added sugars)
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce (or tamari)
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon erythritol or monk fruit sweetener (adjust to taste)
- Salt, to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum (for thickening)

### Garnish
- 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds
- Thinly sliced green onions
- Lemon slices (optional)

## Instructions

### Prepare the Chicken
1. **Marinate**: In a large shallow bowl, whisk together 1 medium egg, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry). Add chicken pieces, mix well, cover, and marinate for 20 minutes.
2. **Fry**: Heat 4 tablespoons avocado oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat (325°F or 165°C). Fry chicken in batches, in a single layer, for 5-6 minutes, turning halfway, until golden and cooked through. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Discard oil and wipe the wok clean.

### Make the Lemon Sauce
1. **Sauté**: Heat 1/2 tablespoon avocado oil in the wok over medium-high heat. Add 1.5 teaspoons minced garlic and sauté until fragrant (about 30 seconds).
2. **Simmer**: Add 1/4 cup chicken broth, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon erythritol or monk fruit sweetener, and salt to taste. Whisk and simmer until the sweetener dissolves.
3. **Thicken**: Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum into the sauce while whisking to avoid clumps, and cook until thickened. Add fried chicken and toss to coat evenly (about 2 minutes).

### Garnish and Serve
1. **Garnish**: Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds, thinly sliced green onions, and lemon slices (if using).
2. **Serve**: Enjoy immediately with cauliflower rice or a keto-friendly side.

## Tools Needed
- Large shallow bowl
- Whisk
- Large wok, pan, or skillet
- Paper towels
- Plate

## Tips
- Use avocado oil or coconut oil for a keto-friendly fat with a high smoke point.
- Adjust erythritol or monk fruit sweetener to balance the sauce’s tanginess.
- For strict keto, omit Shaoxing wine or use a splash of dry sherry with negligible carbs.
- Serve with cauliflower rice or steamed low-carb vegetables like broccoli or zucchini.
- Without the almond flour coating, the chicken will be less crispy but still flavorful due to the marinade and sauce.
