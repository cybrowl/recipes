**Prep Time**: 15 minutes  
**Cook Time**: 25 minutes  

## Ingredients

### Soup Base
- 1 medium head **cauliflower** (about 1 lb/450g), chopped into florets
- 2 tbsp **olive oil**
- 1 small **shallot**, finely chopped
- 2 cloves **garlic**, minced
- 3 cups **chicken bone broth** (or vegetable broth, check for no added sugar)
- 1 cup **heavy cream**
- 1 tsp **truffle oil** (high-quality, white or black)
- 1/2 tsp **salt**
- 1/4 tsp **white pepper** (for elegance)

### Garnish
- 4 oz (115g) **pancetta**, diced
- 1 tbsp **fresh chives**, finely chopped
- Optional: 1 tsp **truffle shavings** (if available, for extra luxury)

## Equipment
- Large saucepan or Dutch oven
- Immersion blender or high-speed blender
- Small skillet (for pancetta)

## Instructions

1. **Cook the Base**:
   - Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic, saut√©ing for 2-3 minutes until softened but not browned.
   - Add cauliflower florets and bone broth. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 15 minutes until cauliflower is very tender.

2. **Blend**:
   - Using an immersion blender (or transfer to a high-speed blender), puree the soup until silky smooth.
   - Stir in heavy cream, truffle oil, salt, and white pepper. Simmer for 5 minutes to meld flavors. Adjust seasoning to taste.

3. **Prepare Garnish**:
   - In a small skillet, cook diced pancetta over medium heat until crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Drain on paper towels.

4. **Serve**:
   - Ladle soup into warmed bowls. Drizzle a few drops of truffle oil on top for aroma. Garnish with crispy pancetta, chives, and optional truffle shavings.
   - Serve immediately with a side of keto bread (like almond flour rolls) if desired.

## Tips
- **Texture**: For Michelin-level smoothness, strain the soup through a fine-mesh sieve after blending.
- **Truffle Oil**: Use sparingly; high-quality truffle oil is potent. Avoid synthetic versions for authentic flavor.
- **Storage**: Refrigerate for up to 3 days. Reheat gently to preserve creaminess.
