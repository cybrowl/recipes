# Ingredients:

1/2 cup (4oz | 125g) unsalted butter
6-8 cloves whole garlic cloves, smashed with the blunt end of a knife
2 sprigs fresh herbs, thyme or rosemary work well
Salt, to taste
1/2-1 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper
4 Steaks of your choice, (I suggest Ribeye, Strip, Porterhouse, T-Bone, Rump, Sirloin, or Eye Fillet for best results)
1-2 tablespoons cooking oil (I suggest canola oil)
Salt and pepper, to season steaks

# Instructions:

Remove steaks from the refrigerator for at least 15-30 minutes before grilling. Cover with wrap or foil.

While steaks are out, melt 1/2 cup of unsalted butter in a small pot or skillet on the grill plates over medium-high heat. Stir the butter continuously and swirl the pan occasionally to allow the butter to cook evenly and prevent too much splattering.

When the butter begins to foam, the color will change from yellow to tan to a rich golden brown color. As soon as you smell a nutty aroma, take the pan off the heat.

Add in 6-8 smashed garlic cloves, 2 sprigs of fresh herbs, pepper, and salt. Give it a light mix with a wooden spoon to evenly brown the garlic and lift up any browned bits on the base of your pan.

Cover and set the browned butter aside to absorb garlic and herb flavors.

Heat the grill over high heat. Lightly grease grill plates with oil. Pat steaks dry with paper towel. Brush lightly with oil and generously season with salt and pepper.

Grill steaks for 4-5 minutes each side until browned and cooked to desired doneness. Spoon a little browned butter over the steaks, then transfer steaks to a warm plate and let rest for 5 minutes if time allows.

Serve with the rest of the browned butter.
