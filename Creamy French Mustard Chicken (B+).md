#Ingredients:
## Meat
2 boneless and skinless chicken breasts, halved horizontally to make 4 fillets

# Seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper
4 tablespoons flour, for dredging **

## Liquids
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup chicken broth
3/4 cup chicken broth **
1/2 cup heavy cream

## Vegetables
1 brown shallot, chopped ** 
4 cloves garlic, minced ** 
8 ounces (250 g) sliced brown mushrooms

# Sauce Ingredients
2 tablespoons butter
1-2 tablespoons Dijon mustard **
1 teaspoon fresh chopped tarragon leaves ** 
1 teaspoon dried thyme ** 
1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped rosemary leaves ** 
Salt and cracked black pepper, to taste

## Instructions:
In a shallow bowl, mix 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper, and 4 tablespoons of flour.

Coat the 2 boneless and skinless chicken breasts with the flour mixture, ensuring they are evenly coated. Shake off the excess and set aside.

In a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil.

Fry the chicken breasts until golden on each side and just cooked through (about 3-4 minutes each side), depending on the thickness of your chicken. Transfer to a warm plate.

In the same pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Saut√© 1 chopped brown shallot for about 4 minutes until soft.

Add 4 cloves of minced garlic to the pan and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Deglaze the pan with 1 cup of chicken broth, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Simmer until reduced to half, about 4 minutes.

Stir in 1-2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard, 3/4 cup of chicken broth, 1 teaspoon of fresh chopped tarragon leaves, 1 teaspoon of dried thyme, and 1/2 teaspoon of fresh chopped rosemary leaves. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to medium.

Stir in 1/2 cup of heavy cream and let it simmer until the sauce starts to thicken, about 3 minutes.

Add the chicken back into the pan and simmer gently until the chicken is heated through and the sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. Taste test and adjust salt and pepper, if desired.

Serve the chicken with the mustard sauce.
