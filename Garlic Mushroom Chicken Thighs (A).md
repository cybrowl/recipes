#Ingredients:
## Meat
7 ounces (209g) boneless skinless chicken thighs (around 2 fillets)

## Seasoning
1/3 teaspoon onion powder
1/3 teaspoon garlic powder
1/6 teaspoon dried thyme
1/6 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/6 teaspoon salt
1/12 teaspoon cracked black pepper
2/3 tablespoon olive oil

## Liquids
1/3 tablespoon butter

## Vegetables
2.6 ounces (74 g) sliced brown mushrooms
1 clove garlic, minced
1/3 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley
1/6 - 1/3 teaspoon each of dried thyme and dried rosemary (adjust to your taste)

## Instructions:
Pat the 7 ounces (209g) chicken thighs dry with paper towel and trim off excess fat.

Combine 1/3 teaspoon onion powder, 1/3 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/6 teaspoon dried thyme, 1/6 teaspoon dried rosemary, 1/6 teaspoon salt, and 1/12 teaspoon cracked black pepper. Coat the chicken evenly with the combined seasoning.

In the same pan or skillet, melt 1/3 tablespoon of butter and add the 2.6 ounces (74 g) sliced brown mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper and cook until soft (about 3 minutes).

Add 1 clove minced garlic, 1/3 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley, 1/6 - 1/3 teaspoon each of dried thyme and dried rosemary (adjust to your taste); saut√© until fragrant (about 1 minute).

Return chicken to the pan. Taste test and season with salt and pepper to your taste. Garnish with fresh parsley. Serve immediately.
