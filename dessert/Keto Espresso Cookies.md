- **Protein**: 3 g

## Ingredients

* **Dry**
  * 150 g super-fine blanched almond flour
  * 14 g coconut flour
  * 10 g Dutch-process cocoa powder *(optional – gives a mocha vibe, omit for pure coffee flavor)*
  * 2 g instant espresso powder (or very finely ground espresso)
  * 2 g baking powder
  * 1 g fine sea salt
  * 65 g erythritol/monk-fruit granulated sweetener
* **Wet**
  * 4 tablespoons (56 g), melted & cooled to lukewarm
  * 1 large egg, room temperature
  * 1 tsp vanilla extract
  * 1 Tbsp brewed espresso **or** heavy cream (adds moisture & extra flavor)
* **Mix-ins (optional)**
  * ¼ cup (40 g) sugar-free dark-chocolate chips
  * 1 Tbsp MCT oil (for an extra fat boost; reduce butter to 3 Tbsp if you add this)

## Smart Oven Setup

1. **Rack Position**  – Wire rack in **Position 3** (middle).
2. **Function**       – Select **COOKIES** ⇒ 325 °F (165 °C).

   * *No Cookies button?* Use **BAKE**, 325 °F, **Convection On / Super Convection** for light crisp edges.
3. **Pre-heat**       – Press **START**; the oven will beep when ready (≈ 3 min).

*Air-Fry Option:* If you want an ultra-crisp exterior, choose **AIR FRY**, 325 °F. Reduce bake time to about 6–7 min (check at 5 min).

## Method

1. **Prep tray**  Line the air-fry basket or the 13-in pizza pan with parchment (parchment keeps keto doughs from welding to the mesh).
2. **Combine dry**  Whisk almond flour, coconut flour, cocoa, espresso powder, baking powder, salt, and sweetener until uniform.
3. **Combine wet**  In another bowl whisk melted butter, egg, vanilla, and brewed espresso/cream until glossy.
4. **Make dough**  Pour wet into dry; stir with a silicone spatula until no dry pockets remain. Dough will be soft but not pourable. Fold in chocolate chips if using.

   * *Too sticky?* Chill 10–15 min; coconut flour will keep absorbing moisture.
5. **Portion**  Scoop \~1 Tbsp balls (≈ 20 g) and arrange 2 in apart on parchment. Flatten lightly with fingertips—they only spread a little.
6. **Bake**  Slide the tray onto the pre-heated rack.

   * **Cookies Mode / Bake:** 8–10 min, rotate halfway for even browning.
   * **Air Fry:** 6–7 min; check early—super convection browns fast.
7. **Cool**  Remove tray; let cookies rest 10 min (they’re fragile hot). Transfer to a rack to finish cooling and crisping.
8. **Store**  Airtight at room temp ≤ 4 days, or freeze up to 3 months.

##### Tips for the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro

* **Use parchment on the air-fry basket** to prevent dough from sagging through the mesh.
* **Super Convection** moves a lot of air—perfect for browning but can push lightweight cookies. Press them down firmly and keep pieces uniform so they don’t fly.
* The **“Rotate Remind”** beep (if enabled) is handy for swapping front ↔ back halfway; keto sweeteners brown unevenly.
* If you live at altitude ≥ 3,500 ft, drop temp to 315 °F and bake 1–2 min longer to avoid excessive spread.

Enjoy your rich, coffee-charged keto treat—with virtually no sugar crash. ☕🍪
