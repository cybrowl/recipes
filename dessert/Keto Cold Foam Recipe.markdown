# Keto Cold Foam Recipe

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream (cold, ensures better frothing)
- 1-2 tsp monk fruit sweetener (granulated or liquid, adjust to taste)
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (for flavor)
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon or cocoa powder (optional, for extra flavor)
- Pinch of sea salt (optional, enhances sweetness)

## Equipment
- Hand mixer, frother, or blender
- Small bowl or tall container

## Instructions
1. **Chill Equipment**: Place your mixing bowl or container in the fridge for 10-15 minutes to keep the cream cold.
2. **Combine Ingredients**: In the chilled bowl, pour the heavy whipping cream, add monk fruit sweetener, vanilla extract, and optional cinnamon/cocoa powder or salt.
3. **Froth the Mixture**: 
   - Use a hand mixer or frother on medium-high speed for 1-2 minutes until the mixture thickens and forms soft peaks. 
   - Alternatively, blend in a blender for 20-30 seconds until frothy but not fully whipped.
4. **Adjust Sweetness**: Taste and add more monk fruit if needed, then froth briefly to mix.
5. **Serve**: Spoon or pour the cold foam over your favorite keto-friendly iced coffee, tea, or sparkling water.

## Tips
- For a thicker foam, whip longer but avoid turning it into butter.
- Store leftover foam in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 24 hours; re-froth before using.
- Experiment with flavors like sugar-free caramel extract or pumpkin spice for variety.
