# Improved Keto Garlic Herb Butter Steaks

Juicy, tender steaks seared to perfection and topped with a rich, garlicky herb-infused butter, perfect for a keto-friendly, high-fat meal.

## Ingredients

### Steaks
- 4 steaks (1.5–2 lbs total; Ribeye, New York Strip, or Filet Mignon recommended for high fat content)
- 2 tablespoons avocado oil (for grilling, keto-friendly)
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### Garlic Herb Butter
- 1/2 cup (4 oz | 125 g) unsalted butter
- 8 cloves garlic, smashed with the flat side of a knife
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme (or 2 sprigs rosemary, or a mix)
- 1 teaspoon fresh chopped parsley (for compound butter)
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional, for depth)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon heavy cream (optional, for creamier butter sauce)

### Garnish
- 1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley
- Flaky sea salt (optional, for finishing)

## Instructions

### Prepare the Garlic Herb Butter
1. **Brown the Butter**: In a small skillet or saucepan over medium heat, melt 1/2 cup unsalted butter. Stir continuously and swirl the pan for 3–4 minutes until the foam subsides and the butter turns golden brown with a nutty aroma.
2. **Infuse Flavors**: Add 8 smashed garlic cloves, 3 sprigs thyme (or 2 sprigs rosemary), 1/2 teaspoon salt, 3/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika (if using). Stir for 30 seconds to release flavors and lift browned bits from the pan. Remove from heat.
3. **Make Compound Butter (Optional)**: For a richer finish, strain half the butter into a small bowl, mix in 1 teaspoon chopped parsley, and let cool slightly. Shape into a log using plastic wrap and chill until firm (about 30 minutes). Keep the remaining butter warm with garlic and herbs for basting.
4. **Add Cream (Optional)**: For a saucier texture, stir 1 tablespoon heavy cream into the warm butter mixture. Set aside, covered, to meld flavors.

### Prepare and Grill the Steaks
1. **Rest Steaks**: Remove 4 steaks from the refrigerator 30–45 minutes before cooking to reach room temperature. Pat dry with paper towels, brush lightly with 2 tablespoons avocado oil, and season generously with salt and pepper.
2. **Preheat Grill**: Heat a grill (or cast iron skillet) to high heat (450°F–500°F). Lightly grease grill grates with avocado oil using a paper towel and tongs.
3. **Grill Steaks**: Place steaks on the grill. Sear for 3–5 minutes per side, depending on thickness and desired doneness (135°F for medium-rare, 140°F for medium). During the last minute of cooking, spoon 1–2 tablespoons of the warm garlic herb butter over each steak, tilting the pan or grill to baste.
4. **Rest Steaks**: Transfer steaks to a warm plate, spoon a bit more garlic herb butter over them, and tent loosely with foil. Let rest for 5–7 minutes to redistribute juices.

### Serve
1. **Garnish**: Slice the chilled compound butter (if made) into rounds and place one on each hot steak, or drizzle with remaining warm garlic butter. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley and a pinch of flaky sea salt (if using).
2. **Serve**: Pair with keto-friendly sides like grilled asparagus, mashed cauliflower with butter, or a spinach salad with olive oil dressing. Serve with garlic cloves from the butter and lemon wedges if desired.

## Tools Needed
- Small skillet or saucepan (for browning butter)
- Cast iron skillet or grill (for cooking steaks)
- Tongs (for handling steaks and greasing grates)
- Wooden spoon (for stirring butter)
- Paper towels (for patting steaks dry and greasing grates)
- Basting brush or spoon (for applying oil and butter)
- Meat thermometer (for checking doneness)
- Plate (for resting steaks)
- Aluminum foil (for tenting steaks)
- Plastic wrap (for compound butter, optional)

## Tips
- **Steak Choice**: Ribeye or New York Strip are ideal for keto due to their higher fat content. Filet Mignon works for a leaner but tender option.
- **Doneness**: Use a meat thermometer for accuracy (135°F for medium-rare, 140°F for medium, 150°F for medium-well).
- **Butter**: Browning the butter adds a nutty depth; watch closely to avoid burning. The compound butter option elevates presentation and flavor.
- **Herbs**: Fresh thyme or rosemary provide the best flavor; a mix of both adds complexity.
- **Storage**: Store leftover steaks and butter in airtight containers in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat steaks gently in a skillet with butter to avoid overcooking.

## Nutritional Notes
- **Carbs**: Negligible carbs from garlic and herbs; no added sugars or starches.
- **Fat**: Butter, avocado oil, and optional heavy cream provide high keto-friendly fat content, especially with fattier cuts like Ribeye.
- **Protein**: Steaks offer ample protein, balancing the high-fat keto profile.
- **Servings**: Makes 4 servings, each with ~1–2 g net carbs (depending on garlic and vegetable sides).
