# Instructions:
## For the chicken marinade:
Combine 2 chicken thighs (400g) cut into bite-sized pieces with 1/3 cup plain yogurt, 1/2 tablespoon minced garlic, 1/2 tablespoon ginger, 2/3 teaspoon garam masala, 1/3 teaspoon turmeric, 1/3 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/3 teaspoon Kashmiri chili (or 1/6 teaspoon ground red chili powder), and 1/3 teaspoon salt.
Let the chicken marinate for 10 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).

## For the sauce:
Heat 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable/canola oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. 
When sizzling, add the marinated chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. 
Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)

In the same pan, melt 1/2 tablespoon of butter. 
Fry 1/2 small onion (finely diced) until soft (about 3 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.

Add 1 teaspoon of finely grated garlic and 1/2 tablespoon of finely grated ginger, and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant.

Then add 1/2 teaspoon garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder, and 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.

Pour in 3.5 oz (100g) of tomato puree, 1/4 teaspoon Kashmiri chili (optional for color and flavor), and 1/4 teaspoon ground red chili powder (adjust to your taste preference). Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown-red color.

Stir 1/3 cup of heavy or thickened cream and 1/4 teaspoon of brown sugar through the sauce. Add the chicken and its juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling. Pour in 1-2 tablespoons of water to thin out the sauce if needed.

Garnish with fresh cilantro or coriander and serve with hot garlic butter rice and fresh homemade Naan bread!
