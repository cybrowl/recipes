# Ingredients:
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon fresh squeezed lemon juice (or juice of half a lemon)
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
3 cloves garlic, minced
21 ounces (600 g) shrimp, peeled and deveined (tail on or off)
Salt to season
Lemon wedges (to serve)
Fresh chopped parsley, to serve

# Instructions:
Heat 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter in a non-stick pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Melt, swirling pan and stirring occasionally for about 3 minutes, or until the foam settles, the butter begins to change color to golden brown, and has a nutty fragrance.

Add 4 tablespoons of honey, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of low-sodium soy sauce, and 1.5 teaspoons of minced garlic; stir well to combine all of the flavors together and cook for 30 seconds until the garlic is fragrant. Remove from heat.

Transfer half of the browned honey/butter mixture from the pan into a separate container. This reserved portion will be used later.

Add half of the 21 ounces of shrimp to the remaining honey/butter mixture in the pan; sear for about 2 minutes each side, or until just cooked through and no longer opaque. Transfer to a plate; set aside.

Clean the pan with a paper towel, then add the reserved honey/butter mixture from the separate container. If the sauce has thickened, add 1 teaspoon of olive oil or extra butter. Sear the remaining shrimp for 2 minutes per side until cooked through and no longer opaque.

Add the cooked shrimp back into the pan, and stir through to evenly coat with the honey/butter sauce. Season with salt and pepper if desired and garnish with fresh chopped parsley.

Serve with steamed vegetables, over rice, or with a salad, and lemon wedges on the side.
