# Chinese Lemon Chicken for 2

#Ingredients:

## For the Chicken:
- 10.5 oz (300 g) chicken tenderloins, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 medium egg
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon Chinese Shaoxing wine
- 4 tablespoons corn starch
- 4 tablespoons peanut oil

## For the Lemon Sauce:
- 1/2 tablespoon peanut oil
- 1.5 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1/4 cup chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice 
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- Salt to taste
- 1 teaspoon corn starch, dissolved in 1 tablespoon water

## For the Garnish:
- 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds
- Thinly sliced green onions
- Lemon slices (optional)

## Instructions:

### For the Chicken:
1. In a large shallow bowl whisk the medium egg, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine together. Add in the chicken pieces, mix well and allow to marinate for 20 minutes, covered.
2. Place 4 tablespoons corn starch into a large baking tray. Pour chicken and marinade into the corn starch and coat chicken pieces evenly, lightly pressing the corn starch around the chicken.
3. Heat 4 tablespoons oil in a large wok, pan or skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is hot (325°F or 165°C), shake off excess corn starch and fry chicken in batches in a single layer for about 5-6 minutes, turning halfway during cooking, until golden and cooked through.
4. Drain on a plate lined with paper towel. Discard oil and wipe wok/pan over with paper towel.

### For the Sauce:
1. Heat 1/2 tablespoon peanut oil over medium-high heat. Sauté 1.5 teaspoons minced garlic until fragrant (about 30 seconds).  
2. Add 1/4 cup chicken broth, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 tablespoon honey, and salt to taste. Whisk, and bring to a simmer until the sugar dissolves.
3. Whisk the corn starch mixture into the simmering sauce and stir until thickened. Toss the fried chicken in the sauce until evenly coated (about 2 minutes).

### For the Garnish:
1. Garnish the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds, thinly sliced green onions, and lemon slices (if using). Serve.
