## Instructions

### 1. Roast & Prep the Bell Peppers

1. **Preheat** oven to **400 °F (200 °C)**.
2. **Roast** peppers on a baking sheet for **18–22 minutes**, turning every 6 minutes, until skins are evenly blistered.
3. **Steam**: Transfer to a bowl and cover with a damp towel (or plastic wrap) for **10 minutes**.
4. **Peel & Core**: Gently remove skins. Slice a lengthwise slit, scoop out seeds and membranes (leave pepper intact). Pat dry inside and out.

> *Dry thoroughly to help the egg batter stick.*

### 2. Make the Filling

1. In a medium bowl, **mix**:

   * 1 cup Monterey Jack (or Pepper Jack)
   * 1 cup shredded chicken or ground beef (if using)
   * ⅛ tsp salt (reserve remaining ⅜ tsp for eggs)
2. **Stuff** each pepper with ¼ of the cheese/meat mixture. Secure edges with toothpicks if needed.

### 3. Whip & Fold the Eggs

1. In a clean bowl, **beat** egg whites + ¼ tsp cream of tartar until **stiff peaks** form.
2. In another bowl, **whisk** egg yolks + ½ tsp garlic powder + ½ tsp ground cumin + remaining ⅜ tsp salt.
3. **Fold** yolk mixture into whites until just combined—keep it fluffy.

> *Gently fold to preserve volume.*

### 4. Pan-Fry the Peppers

1. **Heat** 1 Tbsp avocado oil in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over **medium**.
2. **Coat** each stuffed pepper in the egg batter, then **fry** 2–3 minutes per side until golden.
3. **Transfer** to a baking dish in a single layer.

> *Fry in batches to avoid crowding.*

### 5. Bake with Sauce & Cheese

1. **Preheat** oven to **375 °F (190 °C)**.
2. **Pour** 1 cup tomato sauce (or salsa) over peppers. Sprinkle with ¼ cup cheddar.
3. **Bake** 15 minutes, until sauce bubbles and cheese melts.

> **Make-Ahead**: Assemble through step 4, refrigerate up to 4 hours. From cold, add 5 minutes to bake time.
