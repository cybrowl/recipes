# Keto Chile Rellenos (4 servings)

A low-carb take on classic chile rellenos—crispy, cheesy, and packed with flavor, no breading or deep-frying required.

## Ingredients

### Peppers & Filling
- **4 large poblano peppers**
- **1 cup shredded Monterey Jack** (or Pepper Jack for extra heat)
- **1 cup shredded cooked chicken** *or* **ground beef** (optional, for added protein)
- **1 Tbsp avocado oil** (or extra-virgin olive oil)
- **Toothpicks** (to secure peppers, if needed)

### Egg Coating
- **4 large eggs**, separated
- **¼ tsp cream of tartar** (for stabilizing egg whites)
- **½ tsp salt** (divided)
- **½ tsp garlic powder**
- **½ tsp ground cumin**

### Sauce & Topping
- **1 cup keto-friendly tomato sauce** *or* **sugar-free salsa**
- **¼ cup grated cheddar cheese** (optional topping)

## Instructions

### Roast & Prep the Poblanos
1. **Roast**: Preheat oven to **400 °F (200 °C)**. Place whole poblano peppers on a baking sheet and roast for **15–20 minutes**, turning every 5 minutes, until skins are charred and blistered.
2. **Steam**: Transfer hot peppers to a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap (or a damp kitchen towel), and let steam for **10 minutes**.
3. **Peel & Clean**: Gently peel off blistered skin. Make a lengthwise slit in each pepper, remove seeds and membranes, keeping pepper intact. Set aside.

> **Tip**: Don’t rinse peppers under water to preserve smoky flavor. Use a dry paper towel for stubborn skin.

### Prepare the Filling
1. **Mix**: In a medium bowl, combine **1 cup shredded Monterey Jack** (or Pepper Jack), **1 cup shredded chicken or ground beef** (if using), and **⅛ tsp salt** (reserve remaining ⅜ tsp for egg yolks).
2. **Stuff**: Stuff each poblano with ¼ of the filling, pressing gently to maintain shape. Secure slits with toothpicks if needed.

### Whip & Fold the Eggs
1. **Beat Whites**: In a clean bowl, beat **egg whites** with **¼ tsp cream of tartar** using a hand mixer until **stiff peaks** form.
2. **Mix Yolks**: In another bowl, whisk **4 egg yolks**, **½ tsp garlic powder**, **½ tsp ground cumin**, and remaining **⅜ tsp salt**.
3. **Fold**: Gently fold yolk mixture into whipped whites with a spatula until no streaks remain.

> **Tip**: Keep batter light and fluffy for best coating—avoid over-folding.

### Pan-Fry the Coated Peppers
1. **Heat**: Heat **1 Tbsp avocado oil** in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over **medium heat**.
2. **Coat & Fry**: Dip each stuffed poblano in the egg mixture, coating all sides. Fry for **2–3 minutes per side** until golden-brown and egg coating is set.
3. **Transfer**: Place fried peppers in a baking dish, spacing evenly.

> **Tip**: Fry in batches to avoid crowding and ensure even browning.

### Bake with Sauce & Cheese
1. **Prep**: Preheat oven to **375 °F (190 °C)**. Pour **1 cup keto-friendly tomato sauce** (or sugar-free salsa) over peppers. Sprinkle with **¼ cup grated cheddar** (if using).
2. **Bake**: Bake for **15 minutes**, until sauce bubbles and cheese melts.

> **Make-Ahead**: Assemble through step 4, refrigerate up to 4 hours, and bake from fridge, adding **5 minutes** to bake time.

- **Pro Tips**:
  - Use **room-temperature eggs** for better whipping volume.
  - No plastic wrap? Use a damp kitchen towel to steam peppers.
  - Test pepper doneness with a fork—it should slide in easily.
