**Servings**: 4 (starter) or 2 (main)  
**Net Carbs**: ~5g per serving  
**Prep Time**: 15 minutes  
**Cook Time**: 30 minutes  

## Ingredients

### Soup Base
- 8 oz (225g) **shrimp**, peeled and deveined (fresh or frozen, thawed)
- 8 oz (225g) **scallops**, patted dry (fresh or frozen, thawed)
- 2 tbsp **butter**
- 1 small **shallot**, finely chopped
- 2 cloves **garlic**, minced
- 1 small **leek**, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced (~1/2 cup)
- 2 cups **seafood stock** (or fish stock, check for no added sugar)
- 1 cup **heavy cream**
- 1/2 cup **dry white wine** (or 1 tbsp white wine vinegar for stricter keto)
- 1 pinch **saffron threads** (about 1/8 tsp, high-quality)
- 1/2 tsp **salt**
- 1/4 tsp **white pepper**
- 1 tsp **fresh thyme**, finely chopped (or 1/2 tsp dried thyme)

### Garnish
- 1 tbsp **fresh parsley**, finely chopped
- 1 tsp **lemon zest**
- Optional: 1 tbsp **crème fraîche** (for a creamy swirl)

## Equipment
- Large saucepan or Dutch oven
- Small bowl (for saffron infusion)
- Immersion blender or high-speed blender (optional, for partial blending)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Saffron Infusion**:
   - In a small bowl, soak saffron threads in 2 tbsp warm water for 10 minutes to release their aroma and color. Set aside.

2. **Cook the Base**:
   - In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add shallot, garlic, and leek, sautéing for 3-4 minutes until softened but not browned.
   - Pour in white wine (or vinegar) and deglaze the pan, scraping up any bits. Simmer for 2 minutes to reduce slightly.
   - Add seafood stock, saffron infusion (with water), salt, white pepper, and thyme. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 10 minutes to meld flavors.

3. **Add Seafood**:
   - Add shrimp and scallops to the saucepan. Simmer for 5-7 minutes until the seafood is just cooked through (shrimp should be pink, scallops opaque).
   - Stir in heavy cream and heat through for 3 minutes, keeping the heat low to avoid curdling. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.

4. **Optional Texture Refinement**:
   - For a slightly thicker, Michelin-star-worthy texture, remove half the soup (avoiding seafood) and blend until smooth using an immersion blender or high-speed blender. Return to the saucepan and stir to combine.

5. **Serve**:
   - Ladle chowder into warmed bowls, ensuring an even distribution of shrimp and scallops.
   - Garnish with a sprinkle of parsley, a pinch of lemon zest, and a small dollop of crème fraîche (if using) for an elegant touch.
   - Serve hot, optionally with a keto-friendly side like a small arugula salad dressed with olive oil.

## Tips
- **Seafood Quality**: Use fresh or high-quality frozen seafood for the best flavor. Pat scallops dry to avoid excess water in the chowder.
- **Saffron**: A little goes a long way; use sparingly to avoid overpowering the dish. High-quality saffron is key for authentic flavor.
- **Storage**: Refrigerate for up to 2 days. Reheat gently on low heat to prevent overcooking the seafood or separating the cream.
- **Customization**: Add 1/4 cup diced celery root (celeriac) for extra depth (adds ~1g net carbs per serving) or swap scallops for clams for a different twist.
