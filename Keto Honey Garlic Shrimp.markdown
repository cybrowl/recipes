# Improved Keto Honey Garlic Shrimp

A quick, flavorful keto dish with succulent shrimp in a rich, garlicky butter sauce, balanced with tangy lemon and a hint of sweetness.

## Ingredients

### Main
- 21 oz (600 g) shrimp, peeled and deveined (tail on for presentation or off for ease)
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh-squeezed lemon juice (from about 3/4 lemon)
- 1 1/2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce (or tamari for gluten-free)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger (for added depth)
- 1 1/2 tablespoons erythritol or monk fruit sweetener (adjust to taste)
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream (optional, for creamier sauce)

### Seasoning
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for a spicy kick)

### Garnish
- 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley
- Lemon wedges (for serving)

### Cooking
- 1 tablespoon avocado oil (if needed for thinning sauce)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Sauce**: In a small bowl, mix 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 1/2 tablespoons erythritol or monk fruit sweetener, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (if using). Set aside.
2. **Brown the Butter**: In a large non-stick skillet, melt 5 tablespoons unsalted butter over medium-high heat. Swirl the pan for about 3 minutes until the foam subsides and the butter turns golden brown with a nutty aroma.
3. **Add Aromatics**: Stir in 4 cloves minced garlic and 1/2 teaspoon minced ginger. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.
4. **Cook Shrimp**: Add all 21 oz shrimp to the skillet in a single layer (work in batches if needed to avoid crowding). Sear for 2–3 minutes per side until just cooked through and no longer opaque.
5. **Finish the Sauce**: Pour the prepared sauce mixture into the skillet. Stir gently to coat the shrimp evenly. If using, add 2 tablespoons heavy cream for a richer texture. Cook for 1 minute until the sauce thickens slightly. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.
6. **Garnish and Serve**: Remove from heat, sprinkle with 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley, and serve with lemon wedges. Pair with keto-friendly sides like sautéed zucchini noodles, cauliflower mash, or a mixed green salad with avocado.

## Tools Needed
- Small bowl (for mixing sauce)
- Large non-stick skillet
- Spatula or tongs
- Measuring spoons and cups

## Tips
- Use jumbo shrimp for a more impressive presentation and juicier texture.
- Add heavy cream for a creamier, keto-friendly sauce with extra fat.
- If the sauce thickens too much, thin it with 1 tablespoon avocado oil or a splash of chicken broth (check for no added sugars).
- For extra flavor, zest the lemon before juicing and sprinkle a pinch over the dish.
- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days; reheat gently on low heat to avoid overcooking shrimp.

## Nutritional Notes
- **Carbs**: Soy sauce, lemon juice, and ginger contribute minimal carbs; erythritol/monk fruit adds no net carbs.
- **Fat**: Increased butter and optional heavy cream boost keto-friendly fats.
- **Protein**: Shrimp provide high protein for a balanced keto meal.
