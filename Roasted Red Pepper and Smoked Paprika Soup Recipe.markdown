**Net Carbs**: ~6g per serving  
**Prep Time**: 15 minutes  
**Cook Time**: 30 minutes  

## Ingredients

### Soup Base
- 3 large **red bell peppers** (about 1 lb/450g), roasted and peeled (or use jarred, drained, ~12 oz)
- 2 tbsp **olive oil**
- 1 small **yellow onion**, finely diced
- 1 clove **garlic**, minced
- 2 cups **chicken bone broth** (or vegetable broth, keto-friendly)
- 1/2 cup **heavy cream**
- 1 tsp **smoked paprika** (high-quality, preferably Spanish)
- 1/2 tsp **salt**
- 1/4 tsp **cayenne pepper** (optional, for a slight kick)

### Garnish
- 2 tbsp **mascarpone cheese**, softened
- 1 tsp **olive oil** (for drizzling)
- 1 tbsp **fresh parsley**, finely chopped
- Optional: 2 tbsp **toasted pine nuts** (small amount to keep carbs low)

## Equipment
- Baking sheet (if roasting peppers)
- Large saucepan
- Immersion blender or high-speed blender

## Instructions

1. **Roast Peppers (if using fresh)**:
   - Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Place whole peppers on a baking sheet and roast for 20-25 minutes, turning occasionally, until charred. Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let steam for 10 minutes. Peel, seed, and chop.

2. **Cook the Base**:
   - Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, sautéing for 3-4 minutes until soft.
   - Add roasted peppers, bone broth, smoked paprika, salt, and cayenne (if using). Simmer for 10 minutes.

3. **Blend**:
   - Blend the soup until smooth using an immersion blender or high-speed blender. Return to the saucepan.
   - Stir in heavy cream and heat through for 3-5 minutes. Adjust seasoning.

4. **Serve**:
   - Ladle into bowls. Add a small dollop of mascarpone to each and swirl gently with a spoon for a refined look.
   - Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with parsley, and add a few toasted pine nuts if using.
   - Serve hot, paired with a keto-friendly garnish like a sprinkle of extra smoked paprika.

## Tips
- **Pepper Shortcut**: Use jarred roasted red peppers (check for no added sugar) to save time.
- **Flavor Boost**: Add a pinch of smoked sea salt for extra depth.
- **Storage**: Refrigerate for up to 4 days. Reheat gently to avoid separating the cream.
