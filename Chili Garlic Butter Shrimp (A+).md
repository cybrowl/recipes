# Ingredients:

## Liquids
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons white wine

## Other
1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic
4 tablespoons butter

## Seasoning
Pinch of coarse salt and fresh ground black pepper, to taste

## Vegtables
1 red bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped (adjust to desired spiciness)
1/4 cup chopped parsley

## Meat
1 TJ bag of large shrimp (prawns)

# Instructions:

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan or skillet over medium heat.

Add the 1 1/4 pounds of shrimp, season with salt and pepper to taste, and sear for 2 minutes on each side (until just beginning to turn pink).

Quickly deglaze the pan with a splash of wine or broth (about 2 tablespoons), scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.

Add 4 tablespoons of butter, 1 1/2 tablespoons of minced garlic, 1 finely chopped green bell pepper (adjust to desired spiciness), and 1/4 cup of chopped parsley.

Toss shrimp through the butter sauce and cook for a further 30 seconds - 1 minute until the shrimp is cooked through (being careful not to overcook your shrimp).

Immediately take off heat and serve.
