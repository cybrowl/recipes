## Ingredients

### Meat
- 0.5 pounds (227 g) lean ground beef (80/20 or higher fat for keto)

### Vegetables
- 1/2 small onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
- 1 cup sliced zucchini

### Stir-Fry Sauce
- 1 1/2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce (or tamari for gluten-free)
- 1 tablespoon keto-friendly fish sauce (replaces oyster sauce)
- 1/2 tablespoon dark soy sauce (or additional tamari)
- 1 teaspoon Chinese cooking wine (or dry sherry, optional for strict keto)
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon monk fruit sweetener (replaces sugar, optional)
- 1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum (for slight thickening, optional)

### Cooking Oil
- 1 tablespoon avocado oil (or coconut oil, for keto-friendly fat)

### Garnish
- 1 tablespoon sliced green onions
- 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds
- Optional: 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes or 1 teaspoon sugar-free sriracha for heat

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Sauce**: In a small bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon fish sauce, 1/2 tablespoon dark soy sauce, 1 teaspoon Chinese cooking wine, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, 1 teaspoon erythritol (if using), and 1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum (if using). Set aside.
2. **Sauté Aromatics**: Heat 1 tablespoon avocado oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add 1/2 small sliced onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in 2 cloves minced garlic and 1/2 teaspoon minced ginger, cooking until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
3. **Cook Beef**: Add 0.5 pounds ground beef, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon. Cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Drain excess fat if using leaner beef, but retain some for keto-friendly flavor.
4. **Add Sauce**: Pour half of the prepared sauce over the beef, stirring to coat evenly. Cook for 1 minute to let flavors meld.
5. **Add Vegetables**: Stir in 1 cup sliced zucchini. Cook, stirring frequently, until zucchini is tender but still slightly crisp, about 3-4 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, or red pepper flakes if desired.
6. **Finish and Serve**: Stir in the remaining sauce and cook for 1 more minute. Remove from heat, garnish with 1 tablespoon sliced green onions, 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds, and optional red pepper flakes or sriracha. Serve warm.

## Tools Needed
- Cutting board
- Knife (for chopping vegetables)
- Measuring cups and spoons
- Small bowl (for sauce)
- Whisk (for mixing sauce)
- Large skillet or wok
- Wooden spoon or spatula

## Tips
- Use higher-fat ground beef (80/20 or 85/15) to increase fat content for keto.
- Zucchini adds a low-carb crunch, but you can also use broccoli or bell peppers for variety.
- For extra richness, add 1 tablespoon butter when tossing the vegetables.
- Serve with cauliflower rice or shirataki noodles for a complete keto meal.
- Adjust spice level with red pepper flakes or sugar-free sriracha to taste.

## Nutritional Notes
- **Carbs**: Zucchini is low-carb; fish sauce and tamari have negligible carbs. Erythritol/monk fruit adds no net carbs.
- **Fat**: Avocado oil and higher-fat beef align with keto’s high-fat needs.
- **Protein**: Ground beef provides ample protein, keeping the dish balanced.
