Steaming shrimp burger patties in a cast-iron Dutch oven, like a Smithey, is a gentle cooking method that keeps them moist and tender. Here’s how to do it and the time required to ensure they’re fully cooked:

1. **Preparation**: Form shrimp patties (about ½ to ¾ inch thick) and pat them dry to ensure even steaming. Season as desired.

2. **Dutch Oven Setup**:
   - Add about 1-2 inches of water to the bottom of the Dutch oven, ensuring it doesn’t touch the steaming basket or rack.
   - Place a steaming basket or metal rack inside the Dutch oven to keep the patties above the water.
   - Preheat the Dutch oven over medium heat until the water begins to simmer and produce steam, then reduce to low or medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer.

3. **Steaming Time**:
   - For **½-inch thick patties**, steam for **4-6 minutes**. The patties are done when they reach an internal temperature of **145°F** (63°C), per USDA guidelines, or when they’re opaque and firm but not rubbery.
   - For **¾-inch thick patties**, steam for **6-8 minutes**. Check the internal temperature or cut one open to ensure the center is fully opaque.

4. **Tips for Success**:
   - Place patties in a single layer in the steaming basket to ensure even cooking.
   - Cover the Dutch oven tightly with the lid to trap steam.
   - Use a meat thermometer for precision, as steaming can vary slightly depending on the heat and patty size.
   - Avoid opening the lid too often to maintain consistent steam.

**Total time**: **4-8 minutes**, depending on patty thickness. Check for doneness to avoid overcooking, as shrimp can become tough if steamed too long.
