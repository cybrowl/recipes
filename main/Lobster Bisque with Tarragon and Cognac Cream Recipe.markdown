### Garnish
- 2 tbsp **heavy cream**, whipped with 1 tsp **cognac** (optional, for decadence)

## Equipment
- Large saucepan
- Immersion blender or high-speed blender
- Fine-mesh sieve (for silky texture)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Lobster**:
   - Boil or steam lobster tails for 5-7 minutes until shells are red. Remove meat, chop, and set aside. Reserve shells.

2. **Cook the Base**:
   - In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add lobster shells, shallot, carrot, celery, and garlic. Saut√© for 5 minutes until fragrant.
   - Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Add white wine (or vinegar) and deglaze, scraping up bits.
   - Add seafood stock, bring to a simmer, and cook for 20 minutes to extract flavors.

3. **Strain and Blend**:
   - Remove shells with tongs. Strain soup through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean saucepan for a refined texture.
   - Blend the soup until smooth. Return to the saucepan.
   - Stir in heavy cream, tarragon, salt, and white pepper. Simmer for 5 minutes.

4. **Serve**:
   - Ladle into warmed bowls. Add a small spoonful of cognac-whipped cream (if using) and a few pieces of reserved lobster meat.
   - Sprinkle with chives for a fresh contrast.
   - Serve hot, ideally with a keto-friendly side like a small salad of microgreens.

## Tips
- **Lobster Shortcut**: Use pre-cooked lobster meat and store-bought shells if available to save time.
- **Texture**: Straining is key for a Michelin-star-worthy velvety finish.
- **Storage**: Refrigerate for up to 3 days. Reheat gently to avoid curdling.
