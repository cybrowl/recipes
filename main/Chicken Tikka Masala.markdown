- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)
- 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes (no added sugar)
- 1 cup full-fat coconut milk
- 1/4 cup heavy cream (for extra richness)
- 1 teaspoon erythritol or monk fruit sweetener (optional, to balance acidity)
- Salt, to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum (optional, for thickening)

### Garnish
- 2 tablespoons fresh chopped cilantro
- Lemon wedges (for serving)

### Cooking
- 2 tablespoons avocado oil (for cooking chicken)

## Instructions

### Marinate the Chicken
1. **Mix Marinade**: In a large bowl, combine 1/2 cup Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon each of cumin, coriander, smoked paprika, 1/2 teaspoon each of turmeric, garam masala, salt, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, and 1 teaspoon minced ginger. Stir until smooth.
2. **Marinate**: Add 1.5 lbs chicken thigh pieces to the marinade, toss to coat evenly, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 8 hours for maximum flavor).

### Cook the Chicken
1. **Heat Oil**: In a large non-stick skillet or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons avocado oil over medium-high heat.
2. **Sear Chicken**: Remove chicken from marinade (discard excess marinade). Sear chicken pieces in a single layer for 3–4 minutes per side until golden and partially cooked. Work in batches if needed to avoid crowding. Remove chicken to a plate and set aside.

### Make the Tikka Masala Sauce
1. **Sauté Aromatics**: In the same skillet, melt 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add 1 small chopped onion and cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in 2 cloves minced garlic and 1 teaspoon minced ginger, cooking for 30 seconds until fragrant.
2. **Add Spices**: Stir in 1 teaspoon each of cumin, smoked paprika, garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon each of turmeric, coriander, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne (if using). Cook for 30 seconds to bloom the spices.
3. **Build Sauce**: Add 1 cup crushed tomatoes and 1 teaspoon erythritol (if using). Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in 1 cup coconut milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream. Simmer for another 5 minutes until slightly thickened.
4. **Thicken (Optional)**: If a thicker sauce is desired, sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum while stirring to avoid clumps. Cook for 1 minute.
5. **Combine**: Return seared chicken to the skillet, along with any juices. Simmer for 5–7 minutes until chicken is fully cooked (internal temperature 165°F). Taste and adjust with salt or more lemon juice if needed.

### Garnish and Serve
1. **Garnish**: Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons fresh chopped cilantro and serve with lemon wedges.
2. **Serve**: Enjoy with keto-friendly sides like cauliflower rice, roasted zucchini, or a cucumber salad with olive oil dressing.

## Tools Needed
- Large bowl (for marinating)
- Large non-stick skillet or Dutch oven
- Spatula or tongs
- Measuring cups and spoons
- Cutting board and knife

## Tips
- **Marination**: Marinate overnight for the best flavor infusion.
- **Spices**: Toast whole spices (like cumin or coriander seeds) before grinding for a fresher taste if you have them.
- **Heat Level**: Adjust cayenne or add sugar-free chili sauce for more spice.
- **Creaminess**: The heavy cream adds richness; for a lighter option, use only coconut milk but expect a slightly thinner sauce.
- **Storage**: Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on low heat to prevent curdling.
