**Servings**: 2 (makes one 10-inch pizza)
**Net Carbs**: ~3-4g per serving (crust only, varies with toppings)
**Prep Time**: 10 minutes
**Cook Time**: 15-20 minutes

## Ingredients

### For the Garlic Thin Crust
- 1 cup (100g) **almond flour** (finely ground, blanched)
- 1/4 cup (25g) **coconut flour**
- 1 tsp **psyllium husk powder** (for crispiness and structure)
- 1 tsp **baking powder** (aluminum-free)
- 1/2 tsp **garlic powder** (for garlicky flavor)
- 1/2 tsp **onion powder** (optional, for depth)
- 1/2 tsp **dried Italian seasoning** (oregano, basil, or thyme)
- 1/4 tsp **salt**
- 2 large **eggs**
- 2 tbsp **olive oil** (or melted butter for richer flavor)
- 2 tbsp **warm water** (adjust as needed for dough consistency)
- 1 tsp **minced fresh garlic** (or 1/2 tsp garlic paste for stronger flavor)

### For the Toppings (Customizable, Keto-Friendly)
- 1/3 cup **low-carb marinara sauce** (e.g., Rao’s Homemade, ~3g net carbs per 1/2 cup)
- 1 cup **shredded mozzarella cheese** (full-fat)
- 1/4 cup **grated Parmesan cheese**
- Toppings of choice: pepperoni (check for no added sugar), mushrooms, bell peppers, spinach, or Italian sausage (~1-2g net carbs per topping, depending on amount)
- Optional: fresh basil, red pepper flakes for garnish

## Equipment
- 10-inch **non-stick skillet** (or cast-iron, well-greased)
- Parchment paper (optional, for easier flipping)
- Mixing bowl
- Spatula
- Oven or stovetop with oven-safe skillet

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Dough**:
   - In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together almond flour, coconut flour, psyllium husk powder, baking powder, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, and salt.
   - In a separate small bowl, beat the eggs, olive oil, warm water, and minced garlic until combined.
   - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms. It should be slightly sticky but hold together. If too dry, add 1 tsp water at a time; if too wet, add 1 tsp almond flour.
   - Knead the dough gently for 1 minute until smooth. Form into a ball.

2. **Shape the Crust**:
   - Place the dough on a piece of parchment paper (to prevent sticking). Flatten it into a disc.
   - Cover with another piece of parchment and roll out to a 10-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick for a true thin crust. (Tip: Aim for even thickness to ensure crispiness.)
   - Remove the top parchment.

3. **Cook the Crust (Stovetop Method)**:
   - Heat your 10-inch skillet over medium heat and lightly grease with olive oil or butter.
   - Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to the skillet (remove the bottom parchment if used). If it doesn’t fit perfectly, gently press it to the edges.
   - Cook for 3-4 minutes until the bottom is golden and crisp. Use a spatula to check.
   - Flip the crust carefully (use the parchment to assist if needed) and cook the other side for 2-3 minutes.

4. **Add Toppings**:
   - Spread a thin layer of low-carb marinara sauce (about 1/3 cup) evenly over the crust, leaving a small border.
   - Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan cheese evenly. Add your chosen toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, etc.).
   - Optional: Sprinkle a pinch of extra garlic powder or Italian seasoning for a flavor boost.

5. **Bake the Pizza**:
   - **Oven Option**: Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). If using an oven-safe skillet, transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly. For a crispier top, broil for 1-2 minutes (watch closely to avoid burning).
   - **Stovetop Option**: Cover the skillet with a lid and cook on low heat for 5-7 minutes until the cheese is melted and the toppings are heated through. (This works best with thin toppings.)

6. **Serve**:
   - Remove the pizza from the skillet using a spatula. Let it cool for 1-2 minutes to set.
   - Garnish with fresh basil or red pepper flakes if desired. Slice into 6-8 pieces and serve hot.

## Tips for Success
- **Crispier Crust**: Ensure the skillet is preheated, and don’t skip the stovetop pre-cooking step. Psyllium husk powder is key for a sturdy, crispy texture.
- **Garlic Flavor**: Adjust the minced garlic or garlic powder to taste. For a bolder garlic kick, brush the crust edges with a mix of 1 tsp olive oil and 1/2 tsp minced garlic before baking.
- **Storage**: Store leftover pizza in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in a skillet or oven at 350°F (175°C) for 5 minutes to maintain crispiness.
- **Customization**: Swap almond flour for **sunflower seed flour** (1:1) if nut-free. Avoid over-loading toppings to keep the thin crust from getting soggy.
